### Greetings friends!

I'm Omar, a software developer of humble origins, who holds a fierce love for programming, DX (Developer Experience), and DS (Dark souls).

Currently, I'm working on taking Esports from offline to online at [G-loot](https://company.gloot.com) on our product [GLL](https://play.gll.gg).

Self-development is my jam ðŸ˜Ž; I live for the satisfaction given by overcoming and understanding problems of all magnitudes â€” be it a towering colossus in a game or a riddle in code. And above all, to remain modest and target-oriented while doing so!
